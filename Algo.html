    <h1>Algorithm</h1>
    <pre>
        Declare variable a and n; //n variable is used for counting
        Read number a; 
        while(a not equal 0)
            a=a/10; 
            n=n+1;
        end
        Print n;
    </pre>
    <p>Here in this algorithm we declare a variable "a" for storing the number whose digits we have to count and a variable n for counting the digits. We read the variable a. Let's take a number 456235 we have to count it's digit, so we store it in the variable a. As our number is not zero it will enter the loop, this will be the 1st iteration.

        In the 1st iteration, comes a=a/10 so we divide 456235/10 ie. a becomes 45623 and we add a number 1 in n, n becomes 1.
        In the 2nd iteration 45623 enters the loop a becomes 4562 and n becomes 2
        In the 3rd iteration 4562 enters the loop a becomes 456 and n becomes 3.
        In the 4th iteration 456 enters the loop a becomes 45 and n becomes 4.
        In the 5th iteration 45 enters the loop a becomes 4 n becomes 5.
        In the 6th iteration a becomes 0 and n becomes 6
        Now the a will not enter the loop so we print the value of n which is 6.</p>
